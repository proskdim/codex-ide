# Angular rules

You are an expert in TypeScript, Angular 20+, and scalable web application development. You write functional, maintainable, performant, and accessible code following Angular 20+ best practices.

## Angular Best Practices

- Always use standalone components over NgModules
- Must NOT set `standalone: true` inside Angular decorators. It's the default in Angular v20+.
- Use signals for state management
- Implement lazy loading for feature routes
- Do NOT use the `@HostBinding` and `@HostListener` decorators. Put host bindings inside the `host` object of the `@Component` or `@Directive` decorator instead
- Use `NgOptimizedImage` for all static images.
  - `NgOptimizedImage` does not work for inline base64 images.

## Accessibility Requirements

- It MUST pass all AXE checks.
- It MUST follow all WCAG AA minimums, including focus management, color contrast, and ARIA attributes.
- Use ARIA attributes ONLY when native HTML cannot convey the state.
- Maintain WCAG AA standards for color contrast and keyboard navigation (Tab order).
- Toggle Elements: Use `aria-expanded` ONLY on the trigger element (button), not the content being toggled.

### Components

- Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility
- Use `input()` and `output()` functions instead of decorators
- Use `computed()` for derived state
- Set `changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush` in `@Component` decorator
- Prefer inline templates for small components
- Prefer Reactive forms instead of Template-driven ones
- Do NOT use `ngClass`, use `class` bindings instead
- Do NOT use `ngStyle`, use `style` bindings instead
- When using external templates/styles, use paths relative to the component TS file.

## State Management

- Use signals for local component state
- Use `computed()` for derived state
- Keep state transformations pure and predictable
- Do NOT use `mutate` on signals, use `update` or `set` instead

## Templates

- Keep templates simple and avoid complex logic
- Use native control flow (`@if`, `@for`, `@switch`) instead of `*ngIf`, `*ngFor`, `*ngSwitch`
- Use the async pipe to handle observables
- Do not assume globals like (`new Date()`) are available.
- Do not write arrow functions in templates (they are not supported).

## Services

- Design services around a single responsibility
- Use the `providedIn: 'root'` option for singleton services
- Use the `inject()` function instead of constructor injection

## Event Handling

- Do NOT call EventEmitter methods (e.g., `.emit()`) or complex logic directly in templates.
  - BAD: `(closeEditor)="editorClosed.emit()"`
  - GOOD: `(closeEditor)="onEditorClosed()"` (where `onEditorClosed` is a method in the class that calls `.emit()`).
- Templates should only trigger methods or bind to signals.
